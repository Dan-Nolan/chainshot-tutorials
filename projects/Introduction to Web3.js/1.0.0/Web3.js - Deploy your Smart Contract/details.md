## Web3 JavaScript API
Web3.js is a collection of modules for interacting with a local or a remote ethereum node. Web3.js will allow us to make requests to the contract to read or write data to the network through a JSON RPC API. 

We will use Web3.js in our dApp to interact with the auction contract.

## Compiling through Solc.js

Solc.js can be installed through npm for compiling your smart contract. Make sure to install the version for 0.4.19.

## Deployment

We will deploy our contract to generate ABI and contract address. Deploying our contract to an address makes it available for other peers in the network to make requests to the auction contract.

We will later use the ABI (Application Binary Interface) and contract address to write our React application frontend and utilize contract methods.
