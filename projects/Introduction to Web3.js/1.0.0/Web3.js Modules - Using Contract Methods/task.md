## Web3.js - Using Contract Methods

In this stage we will call some of the auction contract methods that we previously deployed.

## Task

- getContractInfo() - Use contract.methods to call and print out the seller from the auction contract. (the abi and address of the smart contract have been instantiated for you!)

- getTxInfo() - Next, we will print the transaction data of the submitBid() function from the auction contract. Call the getTransaction() method to print out transaction details for the tx hash - `0x62a20316c4029dcf6eb89d968d5b52a757d5503cbee6c96d91485a97f3151fc1`
